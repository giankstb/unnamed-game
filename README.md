Hello, I'm Gian and this is a game I'm working on in my free time. This github repository is here so I can track progress, show my code to people and also to better versionate this project. You can take a look of how it looks by checking the releases, I'll post some stuff there that I think is worth seeing. Keep in mind you'll not see any finished product, just stuff you can mess around with and a few numbers and strings in the screen as a debug method. Feel free to leave suggestions in my code, as a way to make it better. Goodbye!
