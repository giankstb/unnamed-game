THIS A WORK IN PROGRESS, A GAME THAT I'M WORKING ON IN MY FREE TIME AND AS A WAY TO TRACK PROGRESS IN PROGRAMMING AND ALSO TO HAVE BETTER VERSION BACKUPS. I'M USING FREE ASSETS OF WHICH I DON'T KNOW THE ORIGIN, SO IF YOU'RE THE OWNER OF ANYTHING IN HERE, FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME. THESE ASSETS WILL
NOT STAY FOR THE FINAL VERSION, THEY'RE THERE AS A GRAYBOX PROTOTYPE, I WOULD NEVER USE THIS STUFF WITH THE INTENTION OF GAINING ADVANTAGE OVER PEOPLE'S KINDNESS. FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART I THANK EVERYONE WHO MADE THESE ASSETS, AND IF I COULD, I WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR PROJECTS AS WELL.
