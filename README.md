As of april 8th, 2025, I'll be moving this project to a private place. This so I can work better on my art and for the safety of my future code. I'll ocasionally drop some releases here, but the code itself will never be publicly changed.

Hello, I'm Gian and this is a game I'm working on in my free time. This github repository is here so I can track progress, show my code to people and also to better versionate this project. You can take a look of how it looks by checking the releases, I'll post some stuff there that I think is worth seeing. Keep in mind you'll not see any finished product, just stuff you can mess around with and a few numbers and strings in the screen as a debug method. Feel free to leave suggestions in my code, as a way to make it better. Goodbye!
