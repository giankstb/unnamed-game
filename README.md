THIS A WORK IN PROGRESS, A GAME THAT I'M WORKING ON IN MY FREE TIME AND AS A WAY TO TRACK PROGRESS IN PROGRAMMING AND ALSO TO HAVE BETTER VERSION BACKUPS. I'M USING FREE ASSETS OF WHICH I DON'T KNOW THE ORIGIN, SO IF YOU'RE THE OWNER OF ANYTHING IN HERE, FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME. THESE ASSETS WILL
NOT STAY FOR THE FINAL VERSION, THEY'RE THERE JUST THERE AS A GRAYBOX PROTOTYPE, I WOULD NEVER USE THIS STUFF WITH THE INTENTION OF GAINING ADVANTAGE OVER PEOPLE'S KINDNESS. FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEAR I THANK EVERYONE WHO MADE THESE ASSETS, AND IF I COULD, I WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR PROJECTS AS WELL.
